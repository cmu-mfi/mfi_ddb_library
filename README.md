# MFI DDB Library v2.0

Library to stream data to Digital Data Backend (DDB) for the MFI project.


## Installation

**Linux**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cmu-mfi/mfi_ddb_library.git
cd mfi_ddb_library
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**Windows CMD**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cmu-mfi/mfi_ddb_library.git
cd mfi_ddb_library
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -e .
```

MFI DDB Library gives tools to write
* "MQTT Client" which streams data from a "Data Source" to a "MQTT broker". The data source may not be generating MQTT messages directly as per [MFI-DDB schema](./schema/README.md). The library provides a way to convert the data to MQTT messages and stream them to the broker.

To be able to do the above three major classes are provided:

* **Data Adapter**: These are the objects that represent the data that needs to be streamed. These objects are responsible for converting the data to mfi_ddb ingestible structure.
* **Streamer**: This is responsible for publishing MQTT messages to the broker. It uses the data from data adapters to stream the data. Streaming can be event driven using obeserver callback or polling based.
* **Topic Family**: These classes allow streamer to convert data from adapters to MQTT payload as required by respective topic branch (`historian`, `blob`, `kv`)

## Usage

* Review the [examples](examples) for usage.

* **[WIP]** [mqtt_client_tutorial.ipynb](examples/mqtt_client_tutorial.ipynb) gives a step by step tutorial to write your own MQTT client for mfi_ddb franework.

## Streaming Metadata

When streaming data to the broker, following metadata is recorded through the `mfi-ddb` stream:

| Metadata | Description | Recorded as |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| location context | The location context of the data being streamed, which includes the enterprise, site, area, and device. | [topic structure](#topic-structure) |
| attributes | Key-value pairs that provide additional information about the data being streamed. These are defined in the adapter yaml configuration file. | streamed on the same topic before data using the same topic family encoding |
| streaming configuration | The configuration of the data stream, which includes broker information, enterprise and site details. | streamed on the `kv` and `blob` at birth and death of data streaming  |
| adapter configuration | The configuration of the adapter that is streaming the data, which includes all the components and their attributes | streamed on the `kv` and `blob` at birth and death of data streaming |
